# first-middle-last-author

Use case:

An authors publication history is downloaded and you need to find how many times they are the first author.

Usage: 

Data for an author should be scraped from Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) with only the names and link for the publication.

The CSV name needs to be formatted in such a way: LastName FirstInitial MiddleInitial.csv

If no middle name, omit it from the name.

Put each CSV in a folder and select it within the program. The tally for each CSV will be outputted into a singular file in a location you choose.
